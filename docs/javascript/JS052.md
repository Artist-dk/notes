# 🚀 **Frontend Frameworks: React, Vue, Angular Basics**  

Modern web development relies on **frontend frameworks** to build interactive, efficient, and scalable web applications. The three most popular frameworks are **React, Vue, and Angular**. Each has unique features, but they share common goals: **component-based development, reactivity, and performance optimization**.

---

# 🎯 **1️⃣ Why Use Frontend Frameworks?**
Without a framework, developers must manage **DOM updates manually**, leading to complex, error-prone code. Frameworks offer:
✅ **Component-Based Architecture** (Reusable UI components)  
✅ **Virtual DOM (React, Vue)** or **Shadow DOM (Angular)** for optimized rendering  
✅ **State Management** (Easier handling of dynamic data)  
✅ **Routing & Navigation** (For single-page applications - SPAs)  
✅ **Built-in Performance Optimizations**  

---

# 📌 **2️⃣ React Basics**
React is a **JavaScript library** (not a full framework) developed by **Meta (Facebook)** for building **fast, component-based UIs**.

## 🔹 **Key Features of React**
✔ **Component-Based** – UI is split into reusable components  
✔ **Virtual DOM** – Faster updates by efficiently rendering changes  
✔ **JSX (JavaScript XML)** – HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript  
✔ **Hooks** – Manage component state without classes  
✔ **Unidirectional Data Flow** – One-way data binding for better control  

## 🔹 **Installing React**
Use `create-react-app` to quickly set up a React project:
```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## 🔹 **Basic React Component**
```jsx
import React from "react";

function Hello() {
  return <h1>Hello, React! 🚀</h1>;
}

export default Hello;
```
✅ **Functional Component**: Returns JSX (`<h1>` is like HTML inside JavaScript).  

---

## 🔹 **React State & Props**
**State**: Stores dynamic data inside a component.  
**Props**: Pass data between components.  

### 📌 **Example: Using State in React**
```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```
✅ **`useState` Hook** manages component state.  

---

# 📌 **3️⃣ Vue.js Basics**
Vue.js is a **lightweight, progressive framework** for building modern UI applications. Created by **Evan You**, Vue is known for its simplicity and flexibility.

## 🔹 **Key Features of Vue.js**
✔ **Reactivity** – Data binding is automatic and intuitive  
✔ **Component-Based** – Reusable components for better organization  
✔ **Directives (`v-if`, `v-for`)** – Control DOM behavior  
✔ **Vue Router** – Built-in routing system  
✔ **Vuex/Pinia** – State management solutions  

## 🔹 **Installing Vue.js**
Use Vue CLI to create a new project:
```sh
npm install -g @vue/cli
vue create my-vue-app
cd my-vue-app
npm run serve
```

## 🔹 **Basic Vue Component**
```vue
<template>
  <h1>Hello, Vue! 🚀</h1>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: "HelloVue",
};
</script>

<style scoped>
h1 { color: blue; }
</style>
```
✅ **Vue uses a `.vue` file structure** with **template, script, and style sections**.  

---

## 🔹 **Vue State & Data Binding**
Vue's **`data`** function defines component state.

### 📌 **Example: Vue Counter Component**
```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
    <button @click="count++">Increment</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return { count: 0 };
  }
};
</script>
```
✅ `{{ count }}` is **Vue's template syntax** for displaying data.  
✅ `@click="count++"` is a **Vue directive** for event handling.  

---

# 📌 **4️⃣ Angular Basics**
Angular is a **full-fledged framework** developed by **Google** for building large-scale applications.

## 🔹 **Key Features of Angular**
✔ **Two-Way Data Binding** – Automatically syncs UI with data  
✔ **TypeScript-Based** – Uses TypeScript for scalability  
✔ **Directives (`ngIf`, `ngFor`)** – Extend HTML functionality  
✔ **Dependency Injection** – Efficient data handling and service sharing  
✔ **Built-in Routing & Forms Module**  

## 🔹 **Installing Angular**
Use Angular CLI to create a project:
```sh
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new my-angular-app
cd my-angular-app
ng serve
```

## 🔹 **Basic Angular Component**
Angular components use TypeScript and decorators.

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-hello",
  template: `<h1>Hello, Angular! 🚀</h1>`,
  styles: [`h1 { color: red; }`],
})
export class HelloComponent {}
```
✅ **Decorator (`@Component`)** defines an Angular component.  

---

## 🔹 **Angular Data Binding & Directives**
Angular supports **two-way binding** using `[(ngModel)]`.

### 📌 **Example: Angular Counter Component**
```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-counter",
  template: `
    <div>
      <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
      <button (click)="increment()">Increment</button>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class CounterComponent {
  count = 0;

  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }
}
```
✅ **`(click)="increment()"`** listens for button clicks.
