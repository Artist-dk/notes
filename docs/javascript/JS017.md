# 🔥 **Closures in JavaScript: Lexical Scope & Private Variables**  

Closures are one of the most powerful and sometimes confusing features of JavaScript. They are widely used in **data privacy, function factories, event handlers, and callbacks**.

This guide will cover:  
✅ **Closures** – What they are and how they work.  
✅ **Lexical Scope** – How functions access variables from their outer scope.  
✅ **Private Variables** – How closures help create private state.  
✅ **Use Cases** – Real-world examples.

## 🔷 **1. What is a Closure?**
A **closure** is a function that **remembers the variables** from its **outer scope** even after that scope has **finished execution**.

### 🔹 **Basic Closure Example**
```js
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = "I am from outer scope!";

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // Accessing outer variable
    }

    return innerFunction;
}

const closureExample = outerFunction();
closureExample(); // Output: I am from outer scope!
```
✔ **The inner function retains access to `outerVariable`** even after `outerFunction` has finished execution.  
✔ This is possible because of **closures**, which "remember" variables from their parent function.  

---

## 🔷 **2. Lexical Scope & Closures**
Closures are possible because of **lexical scope**.  
💡 **Lexical Scope** means that **inner functions can access variables from their outer functions**.

### 🔹 **Example: Lexical Scope in Action**
```js
function grandparent() {
    let a = "Grandparent's Variable";

    function parent() {
        let b = "Parent's Variable";

        function child() {
            let c = "Child's Variable";
            console.log(a, b, c); // ✅ Can access all variables
        }

        child();
    }

    parent();
}

grandparent();
// Output:
// Grandparent's Variable Parent's Variable Child's Variable
```
✔ The `child()` function has access to `a`, `b`, and `c` because of **lexical scope**.  
✔ The `parent()` function has access to `a` and `b`.  
✔ The `grandparent()` function has access only to `a`.

## 🔷 **3. Closures & Private Variables**
Closures allow us to create **private variables** – variables that **cannot be accessed from outside a function**.

### 🔹 **Example: Using Closures for Data Privacy**
```js
function bankAccount(initialBalance) {
    let balance = initialBalance; // Private variable

    return {
        deposit(amount) {
            balance += amount;
            console.log(`Deposited: ${amount}, New Balance: ${balance}`);
        },
        withdraw(amount) {
            if (amount > balance) {
                console.log("Insufficient funds!");
            } else {
                balance -= amount;
                console.log(`Withdrawn: ${amount}, New Balance: ${balance}`);
            }
        },
        getBalance() {
            console.log(`Current Balance: ${balance}`);
        }
    };
}

const myAccount = bankAccount(100);
myAccount.deposit(50);    // Deposited: 50, New Balance: 150
myAccount.withdraw(30);   // Withdrawn: 30, New Balance: 120
myAccount.getBalance();   // Current Balance: 120
console.log(myAccount.balance); // ❌ Undefined (private variable)
```
✔ `balance` is **not directly accessible** from outside the function.  
✔ `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `getBalance()` form a **closure** around `balance`.

## 🔷 **4. Closures in Function Factories**
Closures are commonly used to **generate functions dynamically**.

### 🔹 **Example: Function Factory**
```js
function multiplier(factor) {
    return function (number) {
        return number * factor;
    };
}

const double = multiplier(2);
const triple = multiplier(3);

console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
console.log(triple(5)); // Output: 15
```
✔ `double` **remembers** that `factor = 2`.  
✔ `triple` **remembers** that `factor = 3`.  
✔ Both functions **retain access** to `factor` even after `multiplier()` has finished execution.  

---

## 🔷 **5. Closures in Event Listeners**
Closures help **retain state** in event handlers.

### 🔹 **Example: Using Closures in Event Listeners**
```js
function createButtonLogger(buttonID, message) {
    document.getElementById(buttonID).addEventListener("click", function () {
        console.log(message);
    });
}

// Assume we have a button with id="btn1"
createButtonLogger("btn1", "Button clicked!");
```
✔ The event handler **remembers** `message` even after `createButtonLogger()` finishes execution.  

---

## 🔷 **6. Closures in Loops & `var` Issues**
When using `var` in loops, closures **capture the last updated value**, causing unexpected behavior.

### 🔹 **Incorrect Behavior with `var`**
```js
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log(i); // Expected: 1, 2, 3 | Actual: 4, 4, 4
    }, 1000);
}
```
✔ The **closure captures `i`**, but by the time the `setTimeout` runs, `i` has already become `4`.  

### 🔹 **Fix Using `let` (Block Scope)**
```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log(i); // Correct Output: 1, 2, 3
    }, 1000);
}
```
✔ `let` **creates a new `i` for each iteration**, preserving expected behavior.  

### 🔹 **Fix Using Closures**
```js
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    (function (num) {
        setTimeout(function () {
            console.log(num);
        }, 1000);
    })(i);
}
```
✔ The **immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)** creates a new **scope for `num`**, preserving the correct value.  

---

## 🔷 **7. Closures in Memoization (Performance Optimization)**
Closures help in **caching results** to avoid redundant computations.

### 🔹 **Example: Memoized Function**
```js
function memoizedFactorial() {
    let cache = {};

    return function factorial(n) {
        if (n in cache) {
            console.log("Fetching from cache...");
            return cache[n];
        }
        console.log("Calculating...");
        if (n === 0) return 1;
        return (cache[n] = n * factorial(n - 1));
    };
}

const fact = memoizedFactorial();
console.log(fact(5)); // Calculating... Output: 120
console.log(fact(5)); // Fetching from cache... Output: 120
```
✔ `cache` persists because of **closures**, preventing redundant calculations.

✔ **Lexical scope** enables inner functions to access variables from their parent functions.  
✔ **Closures help create private variables** for data privacy.  
✔ **Common uses**: Function factories, event handlers, loops, caching (memoization).
