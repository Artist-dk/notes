# **🚀 Introduction to JavaScript**  

## **What is JavaScript?**  
JavaScript (JS) is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** used primarily for **web development**. It allows developers to create **dynamic, interactive** web pages by manipulating the HTML & CSS in real time.  

✅ Initially created for **frontend (client-side) development**, JavaScript is now used in **backend (server-side) development** with **Node.js**.

## **Key Features of JavaScript**  
🔹 **Interpreted & Dynamic** – No need for compilation, and types are flexible.  
🔹 **Event-Driven & Asynchronous** – Uses callbacks, promises, and `async/await` for handling tasks.  
🔹 **Multi-Paradigm** – Supports functional, object-oriented, and procedural programming.  
🔹 **Platform-Independent** – Runs on **browsers, servers, and mobile apps**.

## **How JavaScript Works in the Browser?**
When a webpage loads, JavaScript runs inside the **JavaScript engine** of the browser.  
Popular JS engines include:  
🔹 **V8 Engine** (Chrome, Node.js)  
🔹 **SpiderMonkey** (Firefox)  
🔹 **JavaScriptCore** (Safari)  

JavaScript interacts with:  
✔ **HTML** (Document Object Model – DOM)  
✔ **CSS** (Changes styles dynamically)  
✔ **APIs** (Fetch API, Geolocation API, etc.)
