# **🐳 Running Cypress in Docker: Containerized Test Execution**  

Running Cypress in **Docker** provides a **lightweight, consistent, and isolated environment** for executing tests. This ensures that tests run **identically** across different systems, making it ideal for **CI/CD pipelines** and **scalable test automation**.  

---

## **📌 1️⃣ Why Run Cypress in Docker?**  
✔ **Cross-platform Compatibility** – Run tests on **any OS** without environment conflicts.  
✔ **CI/CD Integration** – Ideal for **GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab, CircleCI**, etc.  
✔ **Lightweight & Reproducible** – No need for local Cypress installation.  
✔ **Headless Execution** – Run tests **without a GUI**, making them faster.  
✔ **Scalability** – Run tests **in parallel** across multiple containers.

## **📌 2️⃣ Official Cypress Docker Images**  
Cypress provides **pre-built Docker images** with **everything needed** to run Cypress tests:  
🔹 **`cypress/included:<version>`** → Comes with Cypress pre-installed  
🔹 **`cypress/base:<version>`** → Basic image without Cypress pre-installed  
🔹 **`cypress/browsers:<version>`** → Includes Cypress + Chrome + Firefox  

> 🚀 **Latest Docker Images**: [Cypress Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cypress/included)

## **📌 3️⃣ Running Cypress in Docker Without Installation**  
If you **don’t** want to install Cypress **locally**, you can run tests directly using Docker.  

### **✅ Quick Start: Run Cypress with One Command**  
```bash
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/e2e -w /e2e cypress/included:13.1.0
```
🔹 `--rm` → Removes the container after execution  
🔹 `-v $PWD:/e2e` → Mounts the **current project** into `/e2e` inside the container  
🔹 `-w /e2e` → Sets `/e2e` as the working directory  
🔹 `cypress/included:13.1.0` → Uses the official Cypress Docker image  

> **💡 Tip:** Replace `13.1.0` with the latest Cypress version.  

---

## **📌 4️⃣ Running Cypress Tests with a Dockerfile**
For **fully containerized test execution**, create a **Dockerfile** in your project.

### **✅ Step 1: Create a `Dockerfile`**
```dockerfile
# Use Cypress official image
FROM cypress/included:13.1.0

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /e2e

# Copy project files into the container
COPY . .

# Run Cypress tests
CMD ["cypress", "run"]
```

### **✅ Step 2: Build the Docker Image**
```bash
docker build -t my-cypress-tests .
```
🔹 This creates a **custom Cypress image** with all project files inside.  

### **✅ Step 3: Run Tests in a Container**
```bash
docker run --rm my-cypress-tests
```
🔹 This runs Cypress tests **inside a container** without affecting the local system.  

---

## **📌 5️⃣ Running Cypress in Headless Mode (CI/CD)**
By default, Cypress runs **in a GUI mode**. To run it **headlessly** in Docker:
```bash
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/e2e -w /e2e cypress/included:13.1.0 cypress run
```
🔹 `cypress run` → Runs tests **without opening the GUI** (ideal for CI/CD pipelines).  

---

## **📌 6️⃣ Running Cypress in a Service Mode (Docker Compose)**
If you need **a web server + Cypress** (e.g., testing a React app), use **Docker Compose**.

### **✅ Step 1: Create `docker-compose.yml`**
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web-app:
    image: node:18
    working_dir: /app
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    command: ["npm", "start"]

  cypress:
    image: cypress/included:13.1.0
    depends_on:
      - web-app
    working_dir: /e2e
    volumes:
      - .:/e2e
    environment:
      - CYPRESS_baseUrl=http://web-app:3000
    command: ["cypress", "run"]
```

### **✅ Step 2: Start Cypress & Web Server**
```bash
docker-compose up
```
🔹 This **starts a web server** and **executes Cypress tests** in a container.  

---

## **📌 7️⃣ Running Cypress in CI/CD (GitHub Actions & Jenkins)**  
Cypress in Docker is **ideal for CI/CD** environments like **GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and GitLab**.

### **✅ GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/cypress.yml`)**
```yaml
name: Cypress Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: cypress/included:13.1.0
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Cypress Tests
        run: cypress run
```
🔹 **`container: cypress/included:13.1.0`** → Runs Cypress inside a Docker container.  

### **✅ Jenkins Pipeline**
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker { image 'cypress/included:13.1.0' }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Run Cypress Tests') {
            steps {
                sh 'cypress run'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
🔹 **Jenkins will pull the Cypress Docker image and execute tests** inside a container.  

---

## **📌 8️⃣ Running Tests in Chrome & Firefox in Docker**
By default, Cypress runs in **Electron**. To test in **Chrome** or **Firefox**, use the `cypress/browsers` image:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/e2e -w /e2e cypress/browsers:node18.14.0-chrome120-ff120 cypress run --browser chrome
```
🔹 This runs tests **in Chrome instead of Electron**.  

---

## **📌 9️⃣ Cypress Docker Best Practices**  
✅ **Use `cypress/included:<version>` for minimal setup**  
✅ **Mount local files with `-v $PWD:/e2e` for debugging**  
✅ **Run headless tests for faster execution**  
✅ **Use `docker-compose` for testing apps requiring a backend**  
✅ **Optimize CI/CD by caching `node_modules` to speed up builds**
