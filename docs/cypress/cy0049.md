# **📌 Integrating Lighthouse for Performance Testing in Cypress**  

Lighthouse is a powerful **open-source tool from Google** that audits web applications for **performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices**. By integrating Lighthouse with Cypress, you can **automate performance testing** and measure key web vitals such as:  

✔ **Page Load Speed (First Contentful Paint, Largest Contentful Paint, Time to Interactive)**  
✔ **SEO & Accessibility Scores**  
✔ **Best Practices for Web Performance**  
✔ **Progressive Web App (PWA) Compliance**

# **🔹 1️⃣ Why Use Lighthouse in Cypress?**  
Cypress is great for **functional testing**, but it doesn’t natively measure **performance metrics**. Integrating Lighthouse allows you to:  

✅ **Run automated performance audits after UI tests**  
✅ **Monitor real-world performance metrics**  
✅ **Get actionable recommendations to improve page speed**  
✅ **Ensure every deployment meets performance standards**

# **🔹 2️⃣ Setting Up Lighthouse with Cypress**  

### **📍 Option 1: Using `cypress-audit` Plugin (Recommended)**  
[`cypress-audit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-audit) integrates **Lighthouse into Cypress**. It allows you to run **Lighthouse audits inside Cypress tests**.

#### **🔹 Step 1: Install Dependencies**  
Run the following command to install `cypress-audit` and Lighthouse:  
```bash
npm install -D cypress cypress-audit lighthouse
```

#### **🔹 Step 2: Update `cypress/support/commands.js`**  
Add `cypress-audit` to Cypress commands:  
```javascript
import { lighthouse, pa11y } from 'cypress-audit';

Cypress.Commands.add('lighthouse', lighthouse);
Cypress.Commands.add('pa11y', pa11y);
```

#### **🔹 Step 3: Add Lighthouse Task in `cypress/plugins/index.js`**  
Modify Cypress plugins to support Lighthouse:  
```javascript
const { lighthouse, prepareAudit } = require('cypress-audit');

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('task', {
    lighthouse: lighthouse(),
    prepareAudit: prepareAudit(),
  });
};
```

# **🔹 3️⃣ Running Lighthouse in Cypress Tests**  

### **📍 Example: Running Lighthouse on a Web Page**  
```javascript
describe('Lighthouse Performance Test', () => {
  it('should check page performance using Lighthouse', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.com');
    
    cy.lighthouse({
      performance: 85, // Minimum Performance Score
      accessibility: 90, // Accessibility Score
      'best-practices': 90, // Best Practices Score
      seo: 90, // SEO Score
    });
  });
});
```
✔ **Passes the test if performance is above 85.**  
✔ **Ensures the website meets SEO, accessibility, and best practice guidelines.**

# **🔹 4️⃣ Measuring Web Vitals with Lighthouse**  
Web vitals include **First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), and Time to Interactive (TTI).**  

### **📍 Example: Running Lighthouse with Specific Metrics**
```javascript
describe('Lighthouse Web Vitals Test', () => {
  it('should measure key performance metrics', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.com');
    
    cy.lighthouse({
      onlyCategories: ['performance'], // Focus on Performance
      thresholds: {
        firstContentfulPaint: 2000, // FCP < 2s
        largestContentfulPaint: 2500, // LCP < 2.5s
        cumulativeLayoutShift: 0.1, // CLS < 0.1
        interactive: 4000, // TTI < 4s
      },
    });
  });
});
```
✔ **Ensures the page loads quickly and smoothly.**  
✔ **Prevents layout shifts that cause a bad user experience.**  

---

# **🔹 5️⃣ Generating Lighthouse Reports**  
Lighthouse generates **detailed reports** showing performance breakdowns.

### **📍 Enabling Report Generation**  
You can configure Cypress to save Lighthouse reports as JSON or HTML:  
```javascript
cy.lighthouse({
  output: 'html', // Save report as HTML
  reportFilename: 'lighthouse-report.html',
});
```
✔ Stores Lighthouse results for debugging.  

---

# **🔹 6️⃣ Running Lighthouse in CI/CD**  
Lighthouse tests can be automated in **GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD**.

### **📍 Example: GitHub Actions for Lighthouse in Cypress**  
Create a `.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml` file:  
```yaml
name: Lighthouse Performance Test

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  lighthouse-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Cypress with Lighthouse
        run: npx cypress run
```
✔ **Automatically tests performance on every pull request.**  

---

# **🔹 7️⃣ Best Practices for Using Lighthouse with Cypress**  
✅ **Run Lighthouse in a headless environment** to speed up tests.  
✅ **Test real user flows** (e.g., login, checkout, dashboard).  
✅ **Optimize pages based on Lighthouse recommendations** (minify JS, lazy load images, optimize fonts).  
✅ **Use thresholds to ensure performance doesn't degrade over time.**
