# **🔥 Cypress Dashboard: Viewing Test Runs, Screenshots, Videos & Reports 🚀**  

The **Cypress Dashboard** is a powerful cloud-based service that helps you **manage, analyze, and share your test runs**. It provides insights into **test performance, error tracking, parallelization, screenshots, videos, and detailed reports**—making it an essential tool for **Cypress test execution at scale**.  

---

# **📌 1️⃣ What is Cypress Dashboard?**
Cypress Dashboard is an **optional service** that enhances Cypress tests by:  
✅ **Storing test results in the cloud** (runs, logs, screenshots, videos).  
✅ **Enabling test analytics** (pass/fail trends, error patterns).  
✅ **Supporting parallel test execution** to speed up CI/CD.  
✅ **Providing debugging tools** for failed tests with logs and stack traces.  
✅ **Allowing team collaboration** by sharing test results across teams.  

🔹 **💡 Note:** While Cypress is free and open-source, the **Cypress Dashboard has free & paid plans** based on usage.

# **📌 2️⃣ Setting Up Cypress Dashboard**
To use the Cypress Dashboard, follow these steps:  

### **✅ Step 1: Install Cypress & Set Up a Project**
If Cypress is not installed, run:  
```sh
npm install cypress --save-dev
```
Initialize Cypress:  
```sh
npx cypress open
```
This creates the **cypress/ directory**.

### **✅ Step 2: Create a Cypress Account**
1. Visit **[Cypress Dashboard](https://dashboard.cypress.io/)**.  
2. Sign up with **GitHub, Google, or email**.  
3. Click **"Create a New Project"**.  
4. Copy the **project ID** (you’ll use it in `cypress.config.js`).

### **✅ Step 3: Connect Cypress to the Dashboard**
Run this command in your project root:
```sh
npx cypress cloud
```
Or manually add the **project ID** in `cypress.config.js`:
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  projectId: "your-project-id",
});
```

### **✅ Step 4: Record Test Runs**
To send test results to the Cypress Dashboard:
```sh
npx cypress run --record --key your-secret-key
```
🔹 Cypress generates a unique **run ID**, and test results appear in the **Dashboard UI**.

# **📌 3️⃣ Viewing Test Runs in Cypress Dashboard**
Once Cypress is connected, you can track test runs in the **Dashboard UI**.

### **✅ Key Features of Test Runs**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Test Summary** | View pass/fail status, execution time, and test history. |
| **Test Details** | Drill down into each test case, with logs and assertions. |
| **Error Stack Traces** | Debug failures with detailed error messages. |
| **Screenshots & Videos** | Review UI failures with recorded media. |
| **Parallelization Insights** | Monitor parallel test execution across multiple machines. |
| **Tagging & Filtering** | Group test runs by tags (e.g., `@smoke`, `@regression`). |

### **✅ Running Tests & Viewing Results**
Run tests in **headless mode and record results**:
```sh
npx cypress run --record
```
View results on **[dashboard.cypress.io](https://dashboard.cypress.io/)** under your project.

---

# **📌 4️⃣ Capturing Screenshots in Cypress Dashboard**
Cypress automatically captures **screenshots** when a test fails.

### **✅ Taking Screenshots Manually**
```javascript
cy.screenshot(); // Takes a full-page screenshot
cy.get('.error-message').screenshot(); // Captures a specific element
```
Screenshots are saved locally in `cypress/screenshots/`, and uploaded to the **Dashboard when running with `--record`**.

### **✅ Where to View Screenshots?**
- **Cypress Dashboard > Test Run Details**  
- Expand a failed test to see **screenshots of the error state**.  
- Download screenshots for debugging.  

---

# **📌 5️⃣ Capturing Videos in Cypress Dashboard**
Cypress **records videos** of test executions by default.

### **✅ Enabling Video Recording**
Cypress automatically records videos when running tests in **headless mode (`cypress run`)**.
```sh
npx cypress run --record
```
### **✅ Video Storage & Access**
| Storage | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Local Storage** | Videos are saved in `cypress/videos/`. |
| **Cypress Dashboard** | Videos are uploaded to the **Dashboard** when running with `--record`. |

🔹 **💡 Tip:** **Disable video recording** to save storage in `cypress.config.js`:
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  video: false,
});
```

---

# **📌 6️⃣ Generating Reports in Cypress Dashboard**
The **Cypress Dashboard** provides detailed reports on test executions.

### **✅ Cypress Dashboard Reports Include:**
| Report Feature | Description |
|---------------|------------|
| **Execution Summary** | Total tests, pass/fail ratio, duration |
| **Performance Trends** | Test execution speed over time |
| **Failure Analysis** | Common failure patterns & stack traces |
| **Team Collaboration** | Share reports via links or integrations |
| **Environment Details** | OS, browser versions, CI/CD pipeline |

### **✅ Exporting Reports**
- Download test reports from the **Dashboard UI**.  
- Integrate Cypress with **Slack, GitHub Actions, or Jira** to receive test reports automatically.

# **📌 7️⃣ Running Tests in CI/CD with Cypress Dashboard**
Cypress Dashboard helps monitor **CI/CD pipelines**.

### **✅ Setting Up Cypress in CI/CD**
1. Add Cypress to your **CI/CD pipeline** (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Jenkins).
2. **Record test results** by adding this to your CI config:
   ```sh
   npx cypress run --record --key your-secret-key
   ```
3. Cypress uploads results, screenshots, and videos to the **Dashboard**.

### **✅ Benefits of Cypress Dashboard in CI/CD**
✅ **Monitor test execution over time**  
✅ **Track test flakiness trends**  
✅ **Rerun only failed tests**  
✅ **Get real-time alerts on test failures**

# **📌 8️⃣ Parallel Test Execution with Cypress Dashboard**
Parallelization helps speed up test execution by running tests on **multiple machines**.

### **✅ Enabling Parallel Execution**
1. **Enable parallel mode** in the Cypress Dashboard settings.  
2. Run tests with `--parallel`:
   ```sh
   npx cypress run --record --parallel --key your-secret-key
   ```
3. Cypress distributes test cases across multiple CI workers.

🔹 **💡 Note:** Parallel execution **requires a Cypress Dashboard account**.
