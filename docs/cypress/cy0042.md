# **🚀 Parallel Test Execution in Cypress**  
Parallel test execution in **Cypress** speeds up test runs by distributing tests across multiple environments or machines. This is essential for reducing execution time in CI/CD pipelines and running tests efficiently across different browsers, operating systems, and network conditions.

---

# **📌 1️⃣ Why Run Cypress Tests in Parallel?**
✅ **Faster Execution** – Distributes tests across multiple environments.  
✅ **CI/CD Optimization** – Reduces build time in GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and CircleCI.  
✅ **Scalability** – Runs tests across multiple machines dynamically.  
✅ **Multiple Browsers** – Ensures compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.  
✅ **Different Configurations** – Tests with different environment variables or APIs.  

---

# **📌 2️⃣ How Parallelization Works in Cypress**
Cypress doesn’t **natively** support parallel execution **without the Cypress Dashboard**. However, you can achieve parallel execution using:  
1. **Cypress Dashboard** (Recommended for enterprise testing).  
2. **Manually splitting tests** across multiple CI/CD jobs.  
3. **Using third-party tools like Docker or Selenium Grid**.

---

# **📌 3️⃣ Running Cypress Tests in Parallel (Using Cypress Dashboard)**
Cypress Dashboard enables **automatic test splitting** across multiple machines.

### **✅ Step 1: Sign Up for Cypress Dashboard**
- Go to **[Cypress Dashboard](https://dashboard.cypress.io/)** and create an account.
- Create a new project and get your **record key**.

### **✅ Step 2: Add Cypress Dashboard Key in `cypress.config.js`**
```js
module.exports = {
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {},
    video: true,
    retries: 2,
  },
  projectId: "your-project-id",
};
```

### **✅ Step 3: Run Tests in Parallel**
Use the Cypress CLI to **split tests automatically**:
```bash
npx cypress run --record --parallel --key YOUR_CYPRESS_DASHBOARD_KEY
```

### **✅ How It Works**
🔹 **`--record`** → Records test results in the Cypress Dashboard.  
🔹 **`--parallel`** → Splits tests across multiple machines dynamically.  
🔹 **`--key`** → API key from Cypress Dashboard for authentication.  

---

# **📌 4️⃣ Running Cypress Tests in Parallel Without Cypress Dashboard**
If you don’t use Cypress Dashboard, you can **manually split tests**.

## **✔ Method 1: Running Parallel Tests in CI/CD**
You can split tests across different **CI jobs**.

### **✅ Example: GitHub Actions (Parallel Jobs)**
Modify `.github/workflows/cypress.yml`:
```yaml
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        shard: [1, 2, 3]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Cypress (Shard ${{ matrix.shard }})
        run: npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/**/*.spec.js"
```
🔹 This runs **3 parallel jobs**, each executing different test files.  

---

## **✔ Method 2: Running Parallel Tests Using Docker**
Docker allows running Cypress across multiple containers.

### **✅ Step 1: Create a `docker-compose.yml` File**
```yaml
version: '3.9'
services:
  cypress-runner-1:
    image: cypress/included:12.17.1
    command: ["cypress", "run", "--spec", "cypress/e2e/test1.spec.js"]

  cypress-runner-2:
    image: cypress/included:12.17.1
    command: ["cypress", "run", "--spec", "cypress/e2e/test2.spec.js"]
```

### **✅ Step 2: Run Tests in Parallel**
```bash
docker-compose up --scale cypress-runner=2
```
🔹 **Scales Cypress containers dynamically** and runs tests concurrently.

---

# **📌 5️⃣ Running Cypress Tests Across Multiple Environments**
You may want to test **different environments** such as **staging, QA, and production**.

### **✅ Defining Multiple Environments in `cypress.config.js`**
```js
module.exports = {
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: "http://localhost:3000",
    env: {
      staging: "https://staging.example.com",
      production: "https://example.com"
    }
  }
};
```

### **✅ Running Tests with Different Environments**
Run Cypress with an environment variable:
```bash
npx cypress run --env baseUrl=https://staging.example.com
```

### **✅ Example: Configuring Tests for Staging & Production**
```js
describe('Login Test', () => {
  it('Visits the correct environment', () => {
    cy.visit(Cypress.env('staging'));
    cy.get('#login').should('be.visible');
  });
});
```

---

# **📌 6️⃣ Running Cypress Tests in Different Browsers**
By default, Cypress runs in **Electron**, but you can run tests across multiple browsers.

### **✅ Running Tests in Chrome**
```bash
npx cypress run --browser chrome
```

### **✅ Running Tests in Firefox**
```bash
npx cypress run --browser firefox
```

### **✅ Running Tests in Multiple Browsers in CI/CD**
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    browser: [chrome, firefox]
steps:
  - run: npx cypress run --browser ${{ matrix.browser }}
```
🔹 Runs tests in **Chrome & Firefox in parallel**.

---

# **📌 7️⃣ Cypress Best Practices for Parallel Execution**
✔ **Use Cypress Dashboard for automatic test splitting**.  
✔ **Manually split tests across CI/CD jobs** if Dashboard isn’t available.  
✔ **Run tests across multiple Docker containers**.  
✔ **Execute tests across multiple environments using `--env`**.  
✔ **Use `--parallel` for running tests in parallel with Cypress Dashboard**.  
✔ **Use CI/CD parallelization strategies (Matrix Jobs in GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI, GitLab)**.
