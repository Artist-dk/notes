# **🔥 Running Cypress Tests: GUI Mode vs. Headless Mode 🚀**  

Cypress offers two main ways to run tests:  

1️⃣ **GUI Mode (`cypress open`)** - Best for debugging and development  
2️⃣ **Headless Mode (`cypress run`)** - Best for automation and CI/CD pipelines  

In this guide, we’ll cover:  
✔ **How to run tests in both modes**  
✔ **Key differences between GUI and Headless mode**  
✔ **When to use each mode**  
✔ **Customizing test execution**

## **📌 1️⃣ Running Cypress in GUI Mode (`cypress open`)**  

GUI mode opens the **Cypress Test Runner**, allowing you to:  
✅ **Manually select test cases**  
✅ **Visually watch tests run in real-time**  
✅ **Debug failed tests with developer tools**  
✅ **Interact with the application while tests execute**  

### **✅ Steps to Run Cypress in GUI Mode**
1. **Navigate to your project folder**  
   ```sh
   cd my-project
   ```
2. **Run Cypress Test Runner**  
   ```sh
   npx cypress open
   ```
   or if installed globally:
   ```sh
   cypress open
   ```

3. The Cypress Test Runner opens:  
   - Select a **browser** (Chrome, Edge, Electron, etc.).  
   - Click on a **test file** to start execution.  

4. **Observe Test Execution**  
   - Tests execute in the selected browser.  
   - Cypress logs **each step** and allows you to inspect elements.

## **📌 2️⃣ Running Cypress in Headless Mode (`cypress run`)**  

Headless mode runs tests **without opening a visible browser**.  
✅ **Faster execution** (no UI rendering overhead)  
✅ **Better suited for CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.)**  
✅ **Auto-generates test results, screenshots, and videos**  

### **✅ Steps to Run Cypress in Headless Mode**
1. **Navigate to your project folder**
   ```sh
   cd my-project
   ```
2. **Run all tests headlessly**
   ```sh
   npx cypress run
   ```
   Cypress will execute all tests and display results in the terminal.

3. **Run specific test files**
   ```sh
   npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/login.cy.js"
   ```

4. **Run tests in a specific browser**
   ```sh
   npx cypress run --browser chrome
   ```
   Supported browsers: `chrome`, `firefox`, `edge`, `electron`

## **📌 3️⃣ Key Differences: GUI Mode vs. Headless Mode**  

| Feature | **GUI Mode (`cypress open`)** | **Headless Mode (`cypress run`)** |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **Execution Speed** | Slower (renders UI) | Faster (no UI rendering) |
| **Debugging** | Easy (interactive, can pause tests) | Harder (relies on logs, screenshots, and videos) |
| **Use Case** | Best for local development | Best for CI/CD and automation |
| **Screenshots & Videos** | No screenshots/videos | Takes automatic screenshots & videos |
| **Test Selection** | Manual (choose test files to run) | Runs all tests by default (or specified ones) |
| **Browser Options** | Choose browsers interactively | Specify browser via CLI |
| **Error Handling** | View test steps in real-time | Need to check logs after execution |

---

## **📌 4️⃣ Customizing Test Runs in Headless Mode**  

### **✅ Run Cypress in a Specific Browser**
```sh
npx cypress run --browser chrome
```
or for Firefox:
```sh
npx cypress run --browser firefox
```

### **✅ Run a Single Test File**
```sh
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/login.cy.js"
```

### **✅ Run a Specific Test Case**
Use `.only` in `it()` or `describe()`:
```js
it.only('Runs this test only', () => {
  cy.visit('https://example.com');
});
```

### **✅ Run Tests with Custom Viewport Size**
```sh
npx cypress run --config viewportWidth=1280,viewportHeight=720
```

### **✅ Save Videos of Test Runs**
By default, Cypress records videos in `cypress/videos/` when running in headless mode.  
To disable:
```sh
npx cypress run --config video=false
```

---

## **📌 5️⃣ When to Use Each Mode?**  

### **✅ Use GUI Mode (`cypress open`) when:**
✔ Debugging tests interactively  
✔ Writing new test cases  
✔ Observing test behavior visually  
✔ Exploring element selectors  

### **✅ Use Headless Mode (`cypress run`) when:**
✔ Running tests in CI/CD pipelines  
✔ Automating test execution  
✔ Running tests faster without UI overhead  
✔ Generating videos/screenshots for failed tests  

---

## **📌 6️⃣ Debugging Failures in Headless Mode**
If a test fails in headless mode:  
✅ **Check terminal logs**: Cypress prints errors in the CLI.  
✅ **Inspect screenshots**: Cypress saves screenshots of failed tests in `cypress/screenshots/`.  
✅ **Replay videos**: Cypress records a video of the test run (`cypress/videos/`).  
✅ **Re-run test in GUI mode**: To inspect issues, open Cypress in GUI mode:  
```sh
npx cypress open
```

---

## **🚀 Summary**
✔ **Use `cypress open`** for debugging and test development.  
✔ **Use `cypress run`** for automation and CI/CD.  
✔ **Customize headless runs** with CLI flags.  
✔ **Debug failures with logs, screenshots, and videos.**
