# **📊 Generating Reports in Cypress**  

Cypress provides multiple options for **generating, customizing, and exporting test reports** to track test execution, failures, and performance. Common reporting tools include:  
✅ **Mochawesome** (HTML & JSON Reports)  
✅ **Allure Reports** (Interactive Test Reports)  
✅ **Cypress Dashboard** (Cloud-based Test Analytics)  

---

# **📌 1️⃣ Why Use Test Reports?**
✔ **Debugging & Analysis** – Identify issues and failures efficiently.  
✔ **CI/CD Integration** – Generate reports in Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.  
✔ **Team Collaboration** – Share test results across teams.  
✔ **Compliance & Documentation** – Maintain a record of test execution over time.  

---

# **📌 2️⃣ Cypress Default Reports**
By default, Cypress logs results in the command line when running tests:  
```bash
npx cypress run
```
However, this **lacks structured reporting**. To generate **detailed reports**, external plugins like **Mochawesome and Allure** are used.

---

# **📌 3️⃣ Generating Reports with Mochawesome**
[Mochawesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mochawesome) is a popular reporting tool that generates **rich HTML and JSON reports**.

### **✅ Step 1: Install Mochawesome**
Run the following command:
```bash
npm install --save-dev mochawesome mochawesome-merge mochawesome-report-generator
```

### **✅ Step 2: Configure Cypress to Use Mochawesome**  
Modify `cypress.config.js`:
```js
const { defineConfig } = require("cypress");

module.exports = defineConfig({
  reporter: "mochawesome",
  reporterOptions: {
    reportDir: "cypress/reports",
    overwrite: false,
    html: true,
    json: true
  }
});
```
🔹 `reportDir` → Saves reports inside `cypress/reports/`  
🔹 `html: true` → Generates an **interactive HTML report**  
🔹 `json: true` → Saves test results in **JSON format**  

### **✅ Step 3: Run Cypress Tests & Generate Report**
Run tests:
```bash
npx cypress run
```
Then, open the report manually:
```bash
npx mochawesome-merge cypress/reports/*.json > cypress/reports/report.json
npx marge cypress/reports/report.json -o cypress/reports
```
This generates a **beautiful HTML report** inside `cypress/reports/index.html`.  

---

# **📌 4️⃣ Generating Reports with Allure**
[Allure](https://www.npmjs.com/package/allure-commandline) provides **interactive and detailed** test reports.

### **✅ Step 1: Install Allure Plugin**
```bash
npm install --save-dev @shelex/cypress-allure-plugin
```

### **✅ Step 2: Configure Allure in Cypress**
Modify `cypress.config.js`:
```js
const { defineConfig } = require("cypress");

module.exports = defineConfig({
  reporter: "allure-mocha",
  reporterOptions: {
    resultsDir: "cypress/reports/allure-results"
  },
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      require("@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin")(on);
      return config;
    }
  }
});
```
🔹 `resultsDir` → Stores reports in `cypress/reports/allure-results`  

### **✅ Step 3: Run Cypress Tests**
```bash
npx cypress run
```

### **✅ Step 4: Generate & Open Allure Report**
```bash
npx allure generate cypress/reports/allure-results --clean
npx allure open
```
This launches an **interactive web-based test report** 📊.

# **📌 5️⃣ Cypress Dashboard Reports**
Cypress Dashboard provides **cloud-based** test reporting, screenshots, and video recordings.  

### **✅ Step 1: Sign Up for Cypress Dashboard**
Go to [Cypress Dashboard](https://dashboard.cypress.io/) and create an account.

### **✅ Step 2: Link Your Project**
Run:
```bash
npx cypress open
```
Then **link your project** to Cypress Dashboard.

### **✅ Step 3: Record Test Runs**
Run tests and send results to Cypress Dashboard:
```bash
npx cypress run --record --key YOUR_CYPRESS_DASHBOARD_KEY
```
🔹 This uploads test execution data, including screenshots and videos.  

### **✅ Benefits of Cypress Dashboard**
✔ **View test history** with execution details.  
✔ **Analyze screenshots/videos** of test failures.  
✔ **Parallel test execution support**.  
✔ **Slack & GitHub integration** for real-time notifications.

# **📌 6️⃣ Running Reports in CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab)**
Reports can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to **automate test reporting**.

## **✅ GitHub Actions (Mochawesome Reports)**
Create `.github/workflows/cypress.yml`:
```yaml
name: Cypress Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Cypress Tests
        run: npx cypress run

      - name: Generate Mochawesome Report
        run: npx mochawesome-merge cypress/reports/*.json > cypress/reports/report.json

      - name: Upload Test Report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: mochawesome-report
          path: cypress/reports/index.html
```
🔹 After the test run, reports will be available as **GitHub artifacts**.  

## **✅ Jenkins (Allure Reports)**
1️⃣ Install **Allure Plugin** in Jenkins.  
2️⃣ Modify `Jenkinsfile`:
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps { checkout scm }
        }
        stage('Run Tests') {
            steps { sh 'npx cypress run' }
        }
        stage('Generate Allure Report') {
            steps { sh 'npx allure generate cypress/reports/allure-results --clean' }
        }
        stage('Publish Allure Report') {
            steps { allure includeProperties: false, jdk: '', results: [[path: 'cypress/reports/allure-results']] }
        }
    }
}
```
🔹 After the pipeline runs, test reports will be available in **Jenkins UI**.
