# **🔥 Cypress Test Execution Modes: Interactive vs. Command Line Execution 🚀**  

Cypress offers **two primary ways** to execute tests:  

1️⃣ **Interactive Mode (`cypress open`)** - Best for **debugging and development**  
2️⃣ **Command Line Execution (`cypress run`)** - Best for **automation, CI/CD, and batch execution**  

Each mode serves a unique purpose in **test development, debugging, and automation**. Let’s explore both in detail.

## **📌 1️⃣ Interactive Mode (`cypress open`)**  

The **Interactive Mode** allows you to run tests **visually in a real browser**, making it ideal for **debugging and writing new test cases**.  

### **✅ Features of Interactive Mode**
✔ **Live Execution** – See tests running step-by-step  
✔ **Real Browser Testing** – Choose browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Firefox  
✔ **Live Debugging** – Pause tests and inspect elements  
✔ **DevTools Integration** – Use browser DevTools for debugging  
✔ **Manual Test Selection** – Pick specific tests to run  

---

### **✅ How to Run Cypress in Interactive Mode**
1. **Navigate to your project folder**  
   ```sh
   cd my-cypress-project
   ```
2. **Start Cypress Test Runner**  
   ```sh
   npx cypress open
   ```
   or, if installed globally:
   ```sh
   cypress open
   ```

3. **Cypress Test Runner opens**, allowing you to:  
   - **Select a browser** (Chrome, Edge, Electron, Firefox, etc.).  
   - **Click on a test file** to start execution.  

4. **Observe test execution**  
   - Watch Cypress interact with your app in real-time.  
   - Hover over commands in the **Command Log** to inspect actions.  

---

### **✅ Benefits of Interactive Mode**
🔹 **Easy Debugging** – View each command and inspect elements  
🔹 **Automatic Waiting** – Cypress waits for elements before interacting  
🔹 **Element Selector Validation** – Check if selectors work before writing assertions  
🔹 **Hot Reloading** – Tests auto-reload when changes are made

## **📌 2️⃣ Command Line Execution (`cypress run`)**  

Command Line Execution runs Cypress **without opening the Test Runner UI**, making it perfect for **automation, CI/CD pipelines, and batch test execution**.  

### **✅ Features of Command Line Execution**
✔ **Runs Tests in Headless Mode (Default)** – No UI rendering = **Faster execution**  
✔ **Supports CI/CD Pipelines** – Works with **Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and CircleCI**  
✔ **Customizable Execution** – Specify browsers, test files, and configurations  
✔ **Records Videos & Screenshots** – Automatically captures test failures  
✔ **Supports Parallel Execution** – Distribute tests across multiple machines  

---

### **✅ How to Run Cypress in Command Line Execution Mode**
1. **Navigate to your project folder**  
   ```sh
   cd my-cypress-project
   ```
2. **Run all tests headlessly**  
   ```sh
   npx cypress run
   ```
   - This will execute all tests in the **Electron browser (default)** in headless mode.

3. **Run tests in a specific browser**
   ```sh
   npx cypress run --browser chrome
   ```
   Supported browsers: `chrome`, `firefox`, `edge`, `electron`

4. **Run a specific test file**
   ```sh
   npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/login.cy.js"
   ```

5. **Run tests in headed mode (with browser UI but via CLI)**
   ```sh
   npx cypress run --headed
   ```

---

### **✅ Benefits of Command Line Execution**
🔹 **Fast & Efficient** – No UI rendering overhead  
🔹 **Ideal for CI/CD** – Seamlessly integrates with DevOps pipelines  
🔹 **Automated Reporting** – Captures logs, screenshots, and videos  
🔹 **Parallelization Support** – Run tests in parallel to reduce execution time

## **📌 3️⃣ Key Differences: Interactive vs. Command Line Execution**  

| Feature | **Interactive Mode (`cypress open`)** | **Command Line Execution (`cypress run`)** |
|---------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Execution Speed** | Slower (renders UI) | Faster (no UI overhead) |
| **Debugging Support** | High (Live UI, DevTools, Logs) | Low (Relies on logs, screenshots, and videos) |
| **Use Case** | Writing & debugging tests | Running tests in CI/CD or automation |
| **Browser Options** | Manually select | Specify via CLI |
| **Test Selection** | Pick individual tests | Runs all or specified tests |
| **Screenshots & Videos** | No automatic screenshots/videos | Saves videos & screenshots automatically |
| **Parallel Execution** | Not supported | Supported (via Cypress Dashboard) |

---

## **📌 4️⃣ Advanced CLI Commands for Custom Execution**  

### **✅ Run Tests in a Specific Viewport**
```sh
npx cypress run --config viewportWidth=1280,viewportHeight=720
```

### **✅ Record Videos**
```sh
npx cypress run --config video=true
```
Videos are saved in `cypress/videos/`.

### **✅ Capture Screenshots of Failures**
```sh
npx cypress run --config screenshotsFolder=cypress/screenshots
```

### **✅ Run Only Failed Tests**
```sh
npx cypress run --config retries=2
```
This retries failed tests **twice** before marking them as failed.

---

## **📌 5️⃣ When to Use Each Mode?**  

### **✅ Use Interactive Mode (`cypress open`) when:**
✔ Debugging test cases  
✔ Writing new test scripts  
✔ Testing UI interactions  
✔ Verifying element selectors  

### **✅ Use Command Line Execution (`cypress run`) when:**
✔ Running tests in CI/CD pipelines  
✔ Automating end-to-end test execution  
✔ Running tests faster without UI overhead  
✔ Generating reports, screenshots, and videos  

---

## **📌 6️⃣ Debugging Failures in Command Line Execution Mode**  
If a test fails in command line execution:  
✅ **Check terminal logs**: Cypress prints errors and logs in the CLI.  
✅ **Inspect screenshots**: Cypress saves screenshots of failed tests in `cypress/screenshots/`.  
✅ **Replay videos**: Cypress records a video of the test run (`cypress/videos/`).  
✅ **Re-run test in Interactive Mode**: To debug, open Cypress in GUI mode:  
```sh
npx cypress open
```

---

## **🚀 Summary**
✔ **Use `cypress open`** for debugging and test development.  
✔ **Use `cypress run`** for automation and CI/CD.  
✔ **Customize command line execution** with CLI flags.  
✔ **Debug failures using logs, screenshots, and videos.**
