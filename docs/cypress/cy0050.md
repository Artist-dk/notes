# **📌 Testing Page Load Speed in Cypress**  

Page load speed is a **critical performance metric** that directly affects user experience and SEO rankings. In Cypress, you can measure key performance indicators such as:  

✔ **First Paint (FP)** – Time for the first pixel to appear on the screen.  
✔ **First Contentful Paint (FCP)** – Time for the first meaningful content to load.  
✔ **Time to First Byte (TTFB)** – Time taken for the server to respond.  
✔ **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** – Time for the largest visible element to load.  
✔ **Total Load Time** – The time taken for the entire page to fully render.

# **🔹 1️⃣ Why Test Page Load Speed?**  
✅ **Improves User Experience** – Faster pages increase user retention.  
✅ **Boosts SEO Rankings** – Google prioritizes fast-loading websites.  
✅ **Reduces Bounce Rates** – Slow websites drive users away.  
✅ **Optimizes Performance** – Helps identify slow-loading assets.

# **🔹 2️⃣ Measuring Page Load Speed with Cypress**  

Cypress doesn't have built-in page speed testing tools, but you can **leverage browser performance APIs** and **integrate Lighthouse** to track metrics.

## **🔹 3️⃣ Checking First Paint & First Contentful Paint (FCP)**  
### **✅ Using `performance.timing` API**  

The **Performance API** provides timing information about different page load phases.  

```javascript
describe('Measure First Paint & FCP', () => {
  it('should track First Paint & First Contentful Paint', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.com');

    cy.window().then((win) => {
      const performance = win.performance.getEntriesByType('paint');
      const firstPaint = performance.find((entry) => entry.name === 'first-paint');
      const fcp = performance.find((entry) => entry.name === 'first-contentful-paint');

      cy.log(`First Paint: ${firstPaint.startTime}ms`);
      cy.log(`First Contentful Paint: ${fcp.startTime}ms`);

      expect(fcp.startTime).to.be.lessThan(2000); // Ensure FCP < 2s
    });
  });
});
```
✔ Extracts **First Paint** and **FCP** values.  
✔ Ensures **FCP is below 2 seconds** for better performance.  

---

## **🔹 4️⃣ Measuring Time to First Byte (TTFB)**  
### **✅ Using Cypress Network Requests (`cy.request()`)**  
TTFB measures **how fast the server responds to a request**.  

```javascript
describe('Measure Time to First Byte (TTFB)', () => {
  it('should track server response time', () => {
    const url = 'https://example.com';

    cy.request(url).then((response) => {
      const ttfb = response.duration; // Time taken to receive first byte
      cy.log(`TTFB: ${ttfb}ms`);

      expect(ttfb).to.be.lessThan(500); // Ensure TTFB < 500ms
    });
  });
});
```
✔ **Validates server response time.**  
✔ **Ensures TTFB is optimized (< 500ms).**  

---

## **🔹 5️⃣ Checking Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) & Total Load Time**  
### **✅ Using `window.performance.timing`**  

LCP measures the time taken for the **largest visible content** (image, text block) to render.  

```javascript
describe('Measure LCP & Page Load Time', () => {
  it('should check LCP & Total Load Time', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.com');

    cy.window().then((win) => {
      const observer = new PerformanceObserver((entryList) => {
        const entries = entryList.getEntries();
        const lcp = entries[0].startTime;

        cy.log(`Largest Contentful Paint: ${lcp}ms`);
        expect(lcp).to.be.lessThan(2500); // Ensure LCP < 2.5s
      });

      observer.observe({ type: 'largest-contentful-paint', buffered: true });
    });

    cy.window().then((win) => {
      const loadTime = win.performance.timing.loadEventEnd - win.performance.timing.navigationStart;
      cy.log(`Total Load Time: ${loadTime}ms`);

      expect(loadTime).to.be.lessThan(4000); // Ensure Load Time < 4s
    });
  });
});
```
✔ Measures **LCP (largest element render time)**.  
✔ Ensures **total load time is under 4 seconds**.

# **🔹 6️⃣ Using Lighthouse for Automated Page Speed Audits**  
Lighthouse provides **detailed performance reports** including FP, FCP, TTFB, and LCP.

### **✅ Install Cypress Lighthouse Plugin**  
```bash
npm install -D cypress-audit lighthouse
```

### **✅ Add Lighthouse Task in `cypress/plugins/index.js`**
```javascript
const { lighthouse, prepareAudit } = require('cypress-audit');

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('task', {
    lighthouse: lighthouse(),
    prepareAudit: prepareAudit(),
  });
};
```

### **✅ Run Lighthouse Audit in Cypress**  
```javascript
describe('Lighthouse Performance Test', () => {
  it('should ensure page load speed is optimized', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.com');

    cy.lighthouse({
      performance: 85, // Minimum Performance Score
      thresholds: {
        firstContentfulPaint: 2000, // Ensure FCP < 2s
        largestContentfulPaint: 2500, // Ensure LCP < 2.5s
        serverResponseTime: 500, // Ensure TTFB < 500ms
      },
    });
  });
});
```
✔ Ensures **performance stays above 85%**.  
✔ Tests **FCP, LCP, and server response time**.

# **🔹 7️⃣ Running Page Load Speed Tests in CI/CD**  
Page speed tests can be **automated in GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD**.

### **✅ GitHub Actions Workflow for Performance Testing**  
Create a `.github/workflows/performance.yml` file:  
```yaml
name: Performance Test

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  performance-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Cypress Performance Tests
        run: npx cypress run
```
✔ Ensures **every PR meets performance benchmarks**.

# **🔹 8️⃣ Best Practices for Page Load Optimization**  
✅ **Enable Caching** – Reduce TTFB with CDN caching.  
✅ **Optimize Images** – Use **WebP, lazy loading** to improve FCP & LCP.  
✅ **Minify JS & CSS** – Reduce blocking resources for faster rendering.  
✅ **Remove Unused Third-Party Scripts** – Reduce slow network requests.  
✅ **Enable HTTP/2** – Improves **TTFB** by multiplexing requests.
