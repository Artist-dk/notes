# **🚀 Cypress with BrowserStack & Sauce Labs: Cross-Browser Testing**  

Cross-browser testing ensures that web applications function **correctly across different browsers and devices**. Cypress primarily runs tests in **Chromium-based browsers**, but **BrowserStack and Sauce Labs** allow running Cypress tests on a **wider range of browsers, including Safari, Edge, and mobile browsers**.  

---

# **🔹 1️⃣ Why Use BrowserStack & Sauce Labs with Cypress?**  
By default, Cypress **only supports Chrome, Edge, and Firefox**. However, with **BrowserStack or Sauce Labs**, you can:  

✅ **Test in Safari, Internet Explorer, Edge, and Mobile Browsers**  
✅ **Run tests on real devices** (iOS, Android)  
✅ **Execute tests in the cloud**, reducing infrastructure costs  
✅ **Perform parallel testing** for faster execution  

---

# **🔹 2️⃣ Setting Up Cypress with BrowserStack**  

## **✅ Step 1: Sign Up & Get API Credentials**  
1. **Create a free account** at [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/)  
2. Navigate to **Automate Dashboard**  
3. Copy your **Access Key & Username** from BrowserStack  

---

## **✅ Step 2: Install BrowserStack Cypress CLI**  
Run the following command in your Cypress project:  

```bash
npm install -g browserstack-cypress-cli
```

---

## **✅ Step 3: Set Up BrowserStack Configuration**  
Create a **`browserstack.json`** file in the root of your project:  

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "username": "<YOUR_BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME>",
    "access_key": "<YOUR_BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY>"
  },
  "browsers": [
    { "browser": "chrome", "os": "Windows", "os_version": "11" },
    { "browser": "firefox", "os": "OS X", "os_version": "Monterey" },
    { "browser": "edge", "os": "Windows", "os_version": "10" }
  ],
  "run_settings": {
    "cypress_config_file": "cypress.config.js",
    "cypress_version": "12.0.0",
    "project_name": "Cypress BrowserStack Demo",
    "build_name": "Build 1"
  }
}
```
✔ **Defines test environments** for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.  
✔ **Uses `cypress.config.js`** as the Cypress test configuration.  

---

## **✅ Step 4: Upload & Run Tests on BrowserStack**  
Upload your Cypress tests to BrowserStack:  

```bash
browserstack-cypress setup
```

Run your tests in the cloud:  

```bash
browserstack-cypress run
```

✔ BrowserStack executes tests in the **cloud across multiple browsers**.  

---

# **🔹 3️⃣ Running Cypress Tests on Sauce Labs**  

## **✅ Step 1: Sign Up & Get API Credentials**  
1. **Create an account** at [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/)  
2. Go to **User Settings** → Copy your **Username & Access Key**  

---

## **✅ Step 2: Install Sauce Labs Cypress Plugin**  
Run the following command:  

```bash
npm install --save-dev @saucelabs/cypress-runner
```

---

## **✅ Step 3: Configure `sauce.config.js`**  
Create a `sauce.config.js` file:  

```javascript
module.exports = {
  sauce: {
    user: "<YOUR_SAUCE_USERNAME>",
    key: "<YOUR_SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY>"
  },
  suites: [
    {
      name: "Cypress Tests",
      browser: "chrome",
      platformName: "Windows 10",
      config: "cypress.config.js"
    },
    {
      name: "Cypress Safari Test",
      browser: "safari",
      platformName: "macOS 12",
      config: "cypress.config.js"
    }
  ],
  sauceConnect: true
};
```
✔ Defines **test environments for Chrome & Safari** on Sauce Labs.  

---

## **✅ Step 4: Run Cypress Tests on Sauce Labs**  
Run tests in the Sauce Labs cloud:  

```bash
saucectl run
```

✔ Executes tests **across multiple browsers** remotely.  

---

# **🔹 4️⃣ Parallel Testing: Speed Up Execution**  
Both BrowserStack & Sauce Labs **support parallel execution**, reducing test time.

## **✅ Running Parallel Tests on BrowserStack**  
Add `"parallels": 3` in `browserstack.json`:  
```json
"run_settings": {
  "parallels": 3
}
```
Then, run tests in parallel:  
```bash
browserstack-cypress run
```

---

## **✅ Running Parallel Tests on Sauce Labs**  
Use `--parallel` when running tests:  
```bash
saucectl run --parallel 3
```
✔ Runs tests **3x faster** across different browsers.  

---

# **🔹 5️⃣ Debugging & Test Reports**  

## **✅ Viewing Test Results in BrowserStack**  
1. Go to **BrowserStack Automate Dashboard**  
2. View **logs, video recordings, and screenshots** for each test  

---

## **✅ Viewing Test Results in Sauce Labs**  
1. Open **Sauce Labs Dashboard**  
2. Check **real-time test execution, logs, and videos**  

---

# **🚀 Key Takeaways**  
✅ **Run Cypress tests on Safari, IE, and Mobile Browsers**  
✅ **Use BrowserStack or Sauce Labs for cloud execution**  
✅ **Execute parallel tests for speed optimization**  
✅ **View logs, screenshots, and videos for debugging**  
✅ **Integrate tests with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)**
